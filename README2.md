1***. Learn Python Basics***
Understand variables, data types, especially lists and dictionaries (used to store tasks).

Practice functions: defining, calling, passing parameters, and returning values (e.g., load_tasks(), show_tasks()).

Study control flow: if-else, loops (while, for), and how to handle user input (input()).
___
2. ***File Handling***
Learn to read and write files with open(), including modes "r" (read) and "w" (write).

Practice JSON serialization with json.dump() and deserialization using json.load() to save/load the task list persistently.
___
3. ***Lists and Dictionaries***
Deep dive on list operations like append(), pop(), and indexing.

Manipulate dictionaries: accessing, updating key-value pairs (tasks["done"] = True).
___
4. ***String Formatting and Display***
Learn formatted string literals (f-strings) for readable output.

Practice printing to the console and formatting task display with symbols and indexes.
___
5. ***Building a Menu-Driven CLI Program***
Understand how to design menu options with numbered choices.

Use loops and conditional statements to continuously prompt for input and perform actions.

Learn input validation to prevent crashes (e.g., checking index validity).
___
6. ***Organizing Code in Functions***
Modularize code by putting logic into reusable functions like load_tasks(), save_tasks(), show_tasks().
___
7. ***Optional: Advanced Topics***
Handle exceptions for invalid inputs (try-except).

Learn basic object-oriented programming (OOP) to encapsulate task list logic into classes.

Add enhancements like editing tasks, marking incomplete, or searching.
